Constant Contact service tests
==============================

This package contains service tests for the core classes of the python SDK.  
These tests require a constant contact developer account to run and a file creds.txt located in this directory with the following 3 lines:

```
{access_token}
{api_key}
{api_base_url (usually https://api.constantcontact.com/v2)}
```

These service tests are not intended to run on an active constant contact account, however, they are included with the repository as some example code for every endpoint.
